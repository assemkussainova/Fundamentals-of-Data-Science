 a team of researchers say that science has relied on a human heterosexual baseline and made faulty assumptions about sexual activity in the animal kingdom 
 male field crickets perform mating songs and dances for each other 
 female japanese macaque monkeys pair off into temporary but exclusive sexual partnerships 
 pairs of male box crabs occasionally indulge in days long marathon sex sessions 
 comparable arrangements can be found in damselflies Humboldt squid garter snakes penguins and cattle 
 but the origins of such same sex sexual behavior have long puzzled evolutionary biologists 
 how could this behavior evolve and persist in so many lineages even when it does not directly aid reproduction 
 that very question may be the wrong one to ask a group of researchers argue in a study published last week in Nature Ecology and Evolution seeking to flip the underlying assumptions of a whole wing of biology 
 instead the researchers suggest that same sex behavior is bound up in the very origins of animal sex 
 evolutionary biologists have long pondered same-sex behavior often describing it as a Darwinian paradox 
 Paul Vasey an expert on non-conceptive sexuality at the university of Lethbridge in Alberta who did not participate in the study says one school of thought held that such behaviors were not primarily sexual instead relating to dominance or grooming 
 other researchers have suggested it persists in some species because it helps social animals maintain communities said Max Lambert a biologist at Berkeley and a co-author on the study 
 still others suggested that examples of same-sex behavior were practice for reproductive sex or even cases of mistaken identity 
 most agreed that it had to have some sort of evolutionary benefit to make up for the presumed costs of nonreproductive sexual behavior 
 none of these explanations satisfied Julia Monk a PhD candidate at Yale and the study lead author 
 the idea that same-sex sexual behavior had to be justified at all seemed like a perspective of dominant cultural norms rather than a more holistic view of the actual biology she said 
 i really disagreed with some of the ways i saw that discussion framed 
 instead of wondering why same-sex behavior had independently evolved in so many species Ms Monk and her colleagues suggest that it may have been present in the oldest parts of the animal family tree 
 the earliest sexually reproducing animals may have mated with any other individual they came across regardless of sex 
 such reproductive strategies are still practiced today by hermaphroditic species like snails and species that do not appear to differentiate like sea urchins 
 over time Ms Monk said sexual signals evolved different sizes colors anatomical features and behaviors allowing different sexes to more accurately target each other for reproduction 
 but same-sex behavior continued in some organisms leading to diverse sexual behaviors and strategies across the animal kingdom 
 and while same-sex behavior may grant some evolutionary benefits an ancient origin would mean those benefits were not required for it to exist 
 but how has same-sex behavior stuck around 
 the answer may be that such behaviors are not as evolutionarily costly as assumed 
 traditionally Ms Monk said any mating behavior that does not produce young is seen as a waste 
 but animal behavior often does not fit neatly into an economic accounting of costs and benefits 
 mating attempts between different sexes do not always efficiently lead to offspring either Dr Kamath said mating attempts can be rebuffed conception may not occur and clutches or young may not survive 
 these are normal hiccups in population-level reproduction and the team predicts that the costs of same-sex behavior are not likely to be any greater 
 i do not think it is unreasonable to assume that at some early stage of animal evolution mating was more indiscriminate and that this is part of the evolutionary heritage of higher animals Dr Vasey said of the study

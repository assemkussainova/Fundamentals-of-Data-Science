i have been posting monthly howtosetup a slip client on a pc posts for a few months lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for march or earlier this month for which i apologize this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota phone and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with phone for additions modifications and corrections i can be reached at ashok@biochemistrycwruedu best wishes ashok begin sliptxt based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows here are my comments on setting up slip in this environment i thank the trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments configuring your modem a turn off dtr atdw i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use to dial my slip server qmodem drops dtr when i exit the program and therefore hangs up the line if you use a program like kermit or conex to establish the slip connection then this need not be done these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit note if you use univ of minn phone to dial and establish a slip connection you do not need to turn off dtr b dial and establish the slip connection first this can be done automatically if you use a program like phone from the university of minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the slip packet driver the phone scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with other slip server in addition while the only packet driver that phone works with is umslip currently it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers there is a section on phone in the document with both script and batch file examples configuring the slip drivers there are five slip packet drivers commonly available cslipperexe peter tattams compressed slip driver slipperexe peter tattams slip driver slipcom crynwr driver i like phil burns modified driver etherslcom crynwr driver ethernet simulation over slip umslipcom univ of minnesota driver based on slip of these four i vastly prefer cslipperexe over slipcom or etherslcom for the following reasons a it is much faster even though my modem has just a uart b while using etherslipslipumslip myself and several others have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a long ftp transfer c it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode d when used in ethernet simulation mode cslipper seem to work with every tcpip application that i have tested it with instructions for cslipperexe and you do not use phone a load slipper in your autoexecbat file according to instructions for instance if you have a vbis modem on com slipper com vec baud b if you use dos tcpip applications in win dos boxes then use the doubleended packet driver shim winpktcom this creates a virtual packet driver at x dos applications in native mode dos applications in windows dos boxes and windows applications can all use this virtual driver at x winpktcom x x c if you use qvtnet load pktintcom next qvtnet is configured in qvtnetini to use the interrupt at x pktintcom instructions for slipcom a try getting a version slip driver philip burns of northwestern university has a modified slipcom driver that is better at hardware handshaking this driver is distributed along with nupop b load the driver after establishing the slip connection my modem is a vbis modem on com so here is how i would load the driver slip w x h slip xf c as discussed above if you use dos tcpip applications in windows x dos boxes you probably want to use winpktcom winpktcom x x d if you use winqvtnet load pktintcom pktintcom instructions for etherslcom if you choose to use etherslcom instead of slipcom the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference you will have to delete the line devicevcd from the enh section of systemini this will interfere with running regular windows comm applications such as crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped characters etc in these applications this is therefore not recommended etherslip would be loaded as ethersl w x h xf configuring windows a make the following modifications to the systemini file enh section i list all your com ports with their addresses and interrupts combasef comirq combasef comirq combasee comirq this can also be done from within windows control panel but doubleclicking on the ports icon ii give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer combuffer iii change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish to use for your modem to zero this is the amount of time that windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to another application if you use winqvtnet and then want to switch from one session to another and this value is at the default value of seconds you are will get a gpf and windows will crash comautoassign this can also be done from within windows control panel doubleclick on enhanced and under device contention set the device contention for the com port your modem is on to never warn additional notes what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each slip session i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user a permanent ip address so i do not have worry about editing qvtnetini each time that i establish a slip connection if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in please try to use bootp aware software and let bootp do the configuration for you however qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection to get qvtnet working in a situation such as this you must do the following edit the qvtnetini file let the net section look like this net name ip netmask or whatever is appropriate for you arptime packetvector or whatever is appropriate save the changes and then writeprotect this file attrib r qvtnetini start your slip connection and remember the name and ip address that you are assigned each time you start qvtnet x the general configuration dialog box will open enter the name and ip address and you were assigned for that session click on ok and you should be up and running the changes you make will not be saved as qvtnetini is writeprotected a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address assignment is provided by victor menayang victor@ccwfccutexasedu victor uses the program bootpq to semiautomate qvtnet preparation bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip which is then saved to a file called myip another file noip is essentially a complete qvtnetini file that lacks the ip address in the final step myip and noip are copied into a single qvtnetini file an example of victors batch file is provided below slipper com pktintcom bootpq i ips myip bootpq i my ip is s copy q net myip noip ecomqvtnetqvtnetini del q myip @echo off echo echo ready to run winqvtnet for questions and more details about bootpq please contact victor menayang victor@ccwfccutexasedu qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvtnet how do you use pktmux over slip pktmux will not work over the slipcom packet driver and crashes immediately if used with etherslcom pktmux will work with cslipperexe when cslipper is used in ethernet simulation mode an example of this configuration is shown below the latest release of pktmux is c and it is important that you use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like trumpet for windows to be released very shortly from autoexecbat lh cslipper com vec baud ether packet driver lh pktmux pktmux loaded for virtual packet drivers lh pktdrv f first virtual packet driver used for qvtnet lh pktintcom qvtnet pktintcom pktdrv pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within windows dos boxes for example my pif file to load popmail is directed to the file popmailbat this is what popmailbat reads like pktdrv loads a virtual packet driver at x cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv u unloads the packet driver at x exit causes the dos window to close i have similar batch files that load other dos tcpip applications like pc gopher it is my experience that pktmux works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt for example within two different dos boxes one for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at x in each instance how much does pktmux degrade the performance of cslipper i have a vbisvbis modem in a running windows with a reasonably fast video card ati graphics ultra under these conditions when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows a driver at xf qvtnet ftp client session b driver at x in one dos window cutcp tn session c driver at x in another dos window trumpet for dos i get ftp transfer rates of kbsec while transferring compressed files this rate is comparable to that which i get with slip loaded as a packet driver and where a single tcpip session is active if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session is active i get transfer rates of kbsec on the same files while there is about degradation in the performance of slipper for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit cslipper and ethernet simulation mode in ethernet simulation mode cslipper ver works with all the applications that i have tested it with one or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at cslipper but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with pktmux i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads ipincorrect packet type or ipbad version number this does not seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning although i cannot comment on loss of performance what can you do if your dos tcpip application does not work with cslipper in ethernet simulation mode in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with cslipper in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author peter tattam peter@psychnetpsycholutaseduau and let him know chances are that he can fix it in the meanwhile you can try the following i do not know if it is kosher but it worked when i had problems with cslipper ver cslipper is loaded at x as described above under the pktmux section i load etherslcom at x run the application and then terminate etherslcom this also works within windows virtual dos boxes however a packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box at a time so for example here is my batch file to run grateful med a medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library of medicine ethersl w x h xf loads etherslip cd gm search cd termin x terminates etherslip exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows if you use this method be cautious about one thing dont have any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time after closing the ethersl window you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no problem btw the example above grateful med works with no problems with cslipper ver phone script files the documentation that accompany phone provide good instructions on writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than the university of minnesota server for example here is a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend background to start a slip connection i dial our terminal server and login with a username and password after doing so i start a slip session with the following command slip usernameslipdialincwruedu followed by my password again here then is the relevant portion of the phonecmd script file cwruts slip login script by ashok aiyar last revised procedure hostcwrulogin

system message login to cwru slip server successful wait endprocedure hostcwrulogin procedure hostcwrulogout nothing special needs to be done to logout endprocedure hostcwrulogout end of script file how to use packet drivers other than umslip with phone the quick answer there is no clean way below is a batch file hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers in this example the packet driver is peter tattams cslipper to use a batch file like this you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver ie interrupt vector baud rate port address and irq this batch file requires umslipcom cslipperexe and termincom to be in the same directory or in your path all that the batch file does is to let you dial the slip connection using phone load the appropriate packet driver hangup the connection and unload the driver when you are done being cwruslipbat @echo off rem this batch file is an ugly hack of u of minn slipbat rem awaiting a version of cslipper that can directly interact rem with phone rem cwruslipbat file is used with phoneexe to start a slip rem connection on cwruts rem last modified ashok aiyar @echo off cls goto start start if goto help if

hello again about a week and onehalf ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers specifically a comparison between the canon bj bubblejet and the hewlettpackard deskjet many people asked me to post the summaryaccount of all the postings and email i received below is my original query and the responses i received i have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find necessary some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there are a wide range of comments each has its own value there was no clear winner some like the bj especially its priceperformance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by hewlettpackard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of refilling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the refills or replacements so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about sheets laser printers will do sheets per toner cartridge well thats a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy hello fellow netters i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj bubblejet vs the hp deskjet i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here which works better under windows any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad well i bought the bj about a month ago at the start of their rebate program on that printer it ends and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of couldnt be beat anywhere i looked and i think its a hot printer just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with pt type done on my bj with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj which is amazing considering that the hp has m ram installed i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders too if you need cdws phone number its delivery to ny was two days good luck craig witkowski ceng@maccvmcorpmotcom motorola communications electronics inc glen rock nj i own a deskjet performance isnt spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on standard photocopy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find copy paper fine still better than dotmatrix comes with a windows driver which seems to bypass print manager has a few intellifontswhich are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype but havent really tried them out can get ram font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldnt bother the ram cartridges cant be used as buffer soft fonts only for graphics ie bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed text is not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text the range of tones for graphic images isnt brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laserlike quality on normal copier paper cant remember the model lx something i think i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand about a month ago i got a canon bj i absolutely love it it is incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i dont know if you ever do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text the only problems ive had are printing headersfooters the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell its not laserprinted by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your face that is if youre nearsighted like me the printer comes with its own driver for windows i have no other complaints the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that havent written a driver for it yet the teenyweeny footprint is a real plus tooand if you purchase it between now and may you get a rebate from canon i bought mine from a store called compusa and the price now is i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at it also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it but it is very slow hope i helped dpi sure looks great heather stehman in article apr@schbbsmotcom ceng@maccvmcorpmotcom craig witkowski writes in message apr@csdnewshoststanfordedu

on the bj printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj which is amazing considering that the hp has m ram installed i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj at work and a deskjet at home i prefer the deskjet the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many nonwindows apps and this will be the case for a long time the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs just my worth mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto po box luling la internet address dmmatt@bigezmonsantocom yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately inch around the paper the bubblejet does not you are right about the graphics resolutions i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down the bubblejet did not i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there finally i wanted sheet feeding in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately more than the deskjet i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money btw i am replacing the bj with a deskjet at work this month anyway regards mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la i spent some time comparing the two we ended up getting the bubblejet bj versus the hp our reasons were the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon dpi versus we felt we could see the difference price canon has a rebate program going on at the moment the bj was our choice over the bjex we could have pages in the bj feeder the bjex holds only pages i think as you can see up to pages on the bj we havent done anything big with the bj but its performance seems reasonable under windows i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but i dont know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canons whereas i dont know where the microsoft bbs one comes from microsoft hope this helps thomas v frauenhofer wayyw tvf@ccicom uunetuupsiccitvf tvf@csritedu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself altough im sometimes also a salesperson if im not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the bj the printing quality is a bit better but you youve got much more possiblities dont forget the hp engine is at least years on the marked the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like eg the epson ones is quite recently available now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlettpackard deskjet dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better ive seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers times the same picture one printed with the bj one with the canon the other with the hp and there was a difference in printing quality the canon was a bit better greetz kris when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers they have near laser quality speed and they are quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bjs i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal anyway we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well out of deskjets and bjs i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp nate whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt ive been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so ive done this a few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers i cant remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the was always at or near the top i bought the c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that although i havens used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result i note that even though you can now get the c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the c and are still readily available at least in the uk the following are my viewsexperience i dont know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performanceprice ratio i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the ideal place to be but the markets still young so one assumes they have the expertise the c is worth the extra operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down and i can tell you that in terms of definition dpi is pretty poor anyway so dpi is just a bit less poor the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack its pretty slow with it god knows what its like without i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so its not in daily use i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start its easy peasy to operate hope this is of use regards david just bought the bj i thought the price couldnt be beat with rebate thru and so far it is comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality speed per page rate seems to be faster i dont have figures i dont print long docs though quality i think the graphics quality is excellent print quality is excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet the dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the pageprint head in place i would imagine large docs not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages manual says up to though havent tried it drivers no problems under win yet winword doesnt want to print the envelopes the same way the canon does though know nothing of addon costs daniel a hartung dhartung@chinetchinetcom ask me about rotaract the deskjet is slow this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned i have no idea how the bubblejet compares the interface between win and the printer is just dandy ive not had any problems with it i just bought a bj printer a couple of days ago i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet and knew that the hp wasnt for me the bj is pretty fast and really prints with good quality i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper i dont have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry very fast probably within a second since canon is giving a rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications wow its funny you should ask this im a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night i was really worried that i wouldnt like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality you cant tell its not laser unless you get inches from the page no problems with drivers the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldnt findi it under windows or wordperfect it works well under both i have yet to install word for windows so dont know how it works with them i had a deskjet at work last year it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow and much noisier than the bubblejet i wont say the bubblejet is much better but i really do like it more just my worth brett sincerely robert

i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iise is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt what i would call fast i dont understand why eisa video cards arent as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a bit bus to move data around instead of isas bits since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar x from pc magazines i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but its around which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still have left over of course id have to get a local bus mother board too can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration thanks christopher wroten cfw@worldstdcom

i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrators point of view i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the most advantageous installation if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but id like to hear it from administrators first the local windows installation windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the resources are available from a network administrators implementation heshe would install all windows disks on a network drive using setupa then install windows on a permachine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives in this way all drivers are available to the setup procedure wo the need to change disks advantages reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files network independence if the network fails and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of downtime faster windows theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone andor the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation disadvantages cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from to percent administration local windows installations are very difficult to administer new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks the backup sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and not user data the shared windows installation windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setupa procedure described above users or administrators then install a minimal set of files to individual user directories these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some files and are accessed shared asneeded by users throughout their windows session the users files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during hisher windows session these include group files ini files and other regularly updated files advantages a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy as an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories the administrator can easily edit any ini file asneeded to correct problems that may arise this includes winini and systemini backup of all pertinent files is done easily even if the users files are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates disadvantages network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since windows is reliant upon the network for its files loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space is still a consideration if the users files are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username in the case of network user files the discussion i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows userbase how they prefer setting up windows personally i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks in fact i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money i would also like to see recommendations for applications should apps such as word andor excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed again i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket if the network crashes work comes to a halt now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with actual working experience with users and network administration

i dont know much about computers so please bear with me heres my question context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the university mainframe an ibm running vmsmvs and log on to my account when i installed slip on my computer i had to configure it for my modem kbs etronics internal and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe the way it works now is that i type telnet uicvm or tn uicvm either will work at the dos prompt uicvm is the node name of the mainframe the program then dials the mainframe establishes a protocol and gives me the logon screen telnet and tn are the names of batch files in my slip directory i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows because i hardly ever use dos directly slip will not run under windows i talked to the people at our computer center and they suggested that i use a packet driver called winpktcom with slip they gave me instructions on how to load it before i start windows and how to modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files in the slip directory to ensure that it would work i did all that and i could run slip from windows but there were other problems for one thing slip would not hang up the phone when i exited i had to run my communi cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that didnt work for another there were too many errors it often took me tries to connect to the mainframe our computer center does not support slip under windows so i cant keep going back to them with more questions question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows and do what slip is supposed to do i need a package that is not too expensive which is why i am looking for shareware i have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this but they cost hundreds of dollars these are the main requirements must be able to run under windows must allow vt and ibm tn terminal emulation must allow ftp file transfers since thats the only kind the mainframe allows no ymodem or zmodem etc i believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol but im hazy about that a subsidiary feature that would be nice to have if its a true windows program rather than a dos program modified to run under windows is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications any information received is appreciated pankaj saxena u@uicvmuicedu

from article cubgkw@worldstdcom by cfw@worldstdcom christopher f wroten i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iise is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isnt what i would call fast i dont understand why eisa video cards arent as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a bit bus to move data around instead of isas bits good question answer the eisa bus does move bits rather than isas but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus i think thats either or mhz the local bus designs also move bits like the eisa but they move the data at the cpu speed up to mhz so on a mhz cpu the local bus is moving bit data at mhz and the eisa is moving bit data at or mhz so the local bus should be to times faster than eisa on a mhz cpu eisa should be about two maybe times as fast as isa since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar x from pc magazines i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but its around which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still have left over of course id have to get a local bus mother board too thats a very good question the eisa bus does have more advantages over the isa bus than just its width for example morebetter interrupts and bus mastering but these other factors do not impact a video card very much they have more impact on file servers with multiple hard drives fullthrottle network cards cdroms etc can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustration thanks christopher wroten cfw@worldstdcom

regarding the horror stories about dosdoubledisk and stacker killing hard drives i was wondering if the dos mirror command works on the doubled drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table if it records the vital doubledisk info then using it daily should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the type of catastrophic failure discussed if it doesnt then shame on microsoft

heres the situation at home i have ms word for windows but no printer at work i have windows a postscript printer but not ms word so i configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer and use the print to file option which produces a nice postscript file which i then bring to work my question how do i print this postscript file through the print manager at work if for example i select print from the file manager it treats the postscript as a text file and gives me several pages of postscript gibberish i know that i can open a dos window and do copy fileps com which does work but seems not to multitask very well other applications run rather slowly and often pause for s of seconds there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print manager but if there is i cant find any mention of it in the documentation anyone know how to do this michael clase memorial university of newfoundland mclase@riemannmathmunca

copyright by thomas b kinsman if desired a postscript version ofthis document is available this information is free you get more than what you pay for dont sue me if im wrong overview the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent bitmap file format what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to me four pixel resolutions are supported bit bit bit and bit pixels these images were intended for use on dos ibm or littleendian systems ifyou are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte swap all short and long integer values by convention dib images end in the extension bmp this is because march they are a superset of earlier bitmap image files consequently you will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files since dib images files are a superset there are three flavors of dib images o dos dib images these are the recommended convention and the form which i will describe how to create they are intended for applications running under ms windows in a dos environment o os dib images my understanding is that these are theflavor of dib images that were used by the presentation manager o oldstyle bitmap images march differences between flavors the dos dib images consist of a bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a dib file thisheaderalso gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data a bitmapinfoheader image header which specifies the image attributes an optional palette of colors used by the image if it exists this may contain or entries each entry is a windows rgbquad structure the image data itself the os dib images consist of the same bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a dib file this header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data a bitmapcoreheader image header which specifies the image attributes an optional palette of colors used by the image again if this exists it may contain or entries each entry is a windows rgbtriple structure the image data itself the old style image bitmap consists of either a bitmapinfoheader or a bitmapcoreheader whichheader type is determined by the first long integer dword value an optional color palette thispalette may be composed of either windowsrgbquad structures if theheaderwas a bitmapinfoheader or windows rgbtriple structures if theheader was a bitmapcoreheader the image data itself creating dib image files creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forwardsteps the headers need to be created and then written to the file these header structures are defined in the ms windows windowshinclude file palette information needs to be stored for images that are not bit images the five general steps are filling in the bitmapfileheader andthe bitmapinfoheader structures the basic image information if the image is a bit bit or an bit image creating the color palette of rgbquads calculating the total file size and putting this information in march the bfsize field of the bitmapfileheader calculating the offset to the image data from thestart of the file and putting this in the bfoffbitsfield of the bitmapfileheader writing to the file the bitmapfileheaderthe bitmapinfoheader the color palette and the image data in that order the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft c type defined keywordsthe following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with microsoft c typedefined keywords in microsoft c typedef meaning byte unsigned character word two byte unsigned integer dword four byte unsigned integer march the bitmapfileheader this structure is defined in windowsh as typedef struct tagbitmapfileheader word bftype dword bfsize word bfreserved word bfreserved dword bfoffbits bitmapfileheader the bftype field is the two ascii characters b and m thisserves toidentify the file as a dib image file on an intel byte ordered machine ibm or a compatible this constant can be formedin c as the quantity m b xd on an intel system the bfsize field is the total size of the file for ourpurposes this field is equal to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the colorpalette times the size of a rgbquad plus the number of bytes of image dataif the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form this value can be calculatedahead of time otherwise this field needs to be filled in later both the bfreserved and the bfreserved fields are always set to zero the bfoffbits field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file for our purposes this field should be set to the size ofthe bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a rgbquad this works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists march the bitmapinfoheader this structure is defined in windowsh as typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader dword bisize dword biwidth dword biheight word biplanes word bibitcount dword bicompression dword bisizeimage dword bixpelspermeter dword biypelspermeter dword biclrused dword biclrimportant bitmapinfoheader the bisize field is set to the size of the bitmapinfoheader structure itself when reading the image filethis value is what is used to determine that the image contains a bitmapinfoheader and not a bitmapcoreheader the biwidth field is the width of the image in image pixels the biheight field is the height of the image in image lines the biplanes field should always be set to this data is written out as if there was one color plane the bibitcount field is the bitdepth of the image this must be either or depending on the bitdepth of the image data the bicompression field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed dibimagessupport two forms of runlength encoding however i have never seen any images which use it and dont know yet how it works set this field to zero long zero or l to indicate that the data is not compressed all subsequent fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure may be set to zero a requirement ofthe interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be biclrused for bitand bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains biclrused colors if you are using only colors with an bit image then you may only want to save of the possible palette entries generally set this field to zero march color palettes each entry of a color palette is a rgbquad structure the rgbquad structure is defined in the windowsh include file as typedef struct tagrgbquad byte rgbblue byte rgbgreen byte rgbred byte rgbreserved rgbquad the rgbreserved field is always zero for each color used theamount of blue green and red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file a value of zero in the rgbblue rgbgreen or rgbred fields indicates thatthat particular component does not contribute to the color composition a value of inany of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition image data there are three surprises about the ordering of image datain dib image file the creator of this format was determined to be creative and certainly was within the image data each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity so if you had an bit image which was only one pixel wide you still have to write out four bytes for every image line the number of bytes per line can be calculated as bytesperline widthinpix bitdepth or in terms of the fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure bytesperline biwidth bibitcount when writing out your image data you must write it out bottom line first the bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file for bit bit and bit images information is writtenas you would expect one bitimagesare padded eight pixels to a byte four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte eight bit images are written one pixel per byte twentyfour bit images are written three bytes per pixel however for bit images the information must be written out in the order blue green red while most image file formats write data out in march an rgb ordering a dib image file writes the data out in an bgr ordering summary this should provide enough informationto create dib images from applications suchas scanners or for image exporting routinesif you find out any more about dib images please pass the information onto me so that i can modify this document accordingly march thomas b

rsrodger@wamumdedu yamanari writes id say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel programs on the other hand i have had os crash randomly a number of times mostly just running its own applications i do know that ibm systems the ps slc in particular have absolutely no problem with osnever had a random crash while running any of my programs under os in fact i dont remember ever crashing of course i really dont run any os programs just the same bunch of dos and windows stuff that ive always been running and when i had the slc this is the slc system running doswindows i had only one crash and it was consistent ftp had a tendency to crash whenever i would get large files mb from particularly fast clients dtrs kksec i figured out the problem was with smartdrvs write bufferingif i turned off the write buffer everything would work fine ftp under os has never locked though i can even format floppies to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os for instance im still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp dos locks up my system yeah i guess im willing to admit that os is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware wp for dos works perfectly fine on my slc please explain the only time i wait on anything under windows is when im copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not longi get to pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do thingsslowlywhile its doing thisive downloaded with pp @ while printing well i save all my personal files to floppy and when i did that under windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the system i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal computation in the background and not being able to address your memory better than dos not sure what you mean here the idea is that oss dos sessions can see more memory than windows dos sessions i let xpl a shareware calculus program see around kb of free conventional memory which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight dos where it would see around kb of conventional ram i also found it really handy for my own dosbased programs which without any rewriting could now handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations etc of course the point is now moot since the os programs i now write simply never run into memory limitations i never programmed for windows so i dont have much of a comparison here though

registration form included in the readme file cosypak is available via anonymous ftp from mishnaesyscwruedu internet no in the pub directory ps a typical ftp session in unix is given after the readme

for all the help ftp cosypak is available by anonymous ftp from mishnaesyscwruedu internet no a sample ftp session is given at the end of this file changes in version update from v to v in this version we have revised cosypak to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v since mathematica provides a better and working laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than mathematica v did we adopted them this has made cosypak smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the cosypak v are no longer needed directly by cosypak v for power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing available at the anonymous ftp site gausseedspgatechedu or ip on the downside the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica requires more runtime resources than its previous version for mathematica users we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica in the directory for please move all files and directory under for into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory introduction this is an unsupported release of cosypak a control systems analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using mathematica classical control systems analysis and design methods and some modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a next tm computer a unix based workstation they have been used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control engineering texts ogata phillips and harbor for undergraduate courses in control engineering i taught at the systems engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers tm and ibm pcs tm running ms windowstm we would be very much interested to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on platforms not mentioned above ibm users however will have to evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics once installed see below for instructions this collection of mathematica packages can be loaded by any user bundled with the packages are many notebooks cosynotes which demonstrate the functionality of these packages the notebooks follow a plan of many fine standard undergraduate control engineering text books listed in the references examples used in these notebooks have been collected from the

hello all it is my understanding that all truetype fonts in windows are loaded in prior to starting windows this makes getting into windows quite slow if you have hundreds of them as i do first off am i correct in this thinking secondly if that is the case can you get windows to ignore them on boot and maybe make something like a pif file to load them only when you enter the applications that need fonts any ideas chris origin chrisdoelle@fnzfidonetorg

i really think you are comparing apples and oranges nobody disputes that os has more big os features the question is does an individual need the power the sales of windows vs os answer that question the next question is even if i did want to run os and i had this big monster machine to run it on is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work go to your local computer store to answer this one i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os this is where the new battle lines will be drawn windows has won the single user pc war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are nt os unix and netware granted these oss will be eventually scaled down to be attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii of the war who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure is fun watching and arguing about it tho thx dave l

hello phjm you wrote firstly does windows in enhanced mode do anything special with dlls that have been compiled using the large memory model no we are being told that even in enhanced mode windows will load dlls into real memory below k and pagelock it no my second question relates to static data inside dlls is there any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data segment dgroup no but you can allocate real static data within code segments when you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap you can forget most of what was written about memory management under you have paged virtual memory you can lock every block without hampering the memory manager you can use far pointer everytime without always lock unlocking the memory block an besides dlls are mostly just disguised exes that happen to be called by another task karl karlwgeitz hauptstr w salzgitter kwgeitz@slinkescapede tel fax cis bix geitzkwg crosspoint v

i have been backing up my hard drive ever since i had to reinstall everything from scratch after a crash learned the hard way didnt i i am using a windowsbased backup program actually norton and i began wondering about the logic of this sure if i accidentally delete a file i can get it from the archive but what if my disk crashes again i would not be able to start windows to run the backup program note by crash i mean there was some error message that prevented the machine from booting properly i think i gave up too early but i didnt have the timepatiencetools to figure out exactly what the problem was my hard drive needed cleaning up anyway yeah right this whole scenario is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker so i think there are possibilities im right if my disk really crashes i would at least have to reinstall dos and windows to get the backup program working im wrong there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk that can easily restore its state from scratch the polls are open tom ioerger univeristy of illinois cs grad student ioerger@csuiucedu

youre right you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii k disk or apple ii disk without extra hardware however mac mb disks can be read and written in a pc hd drive with software only this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file it sure gets asked enough i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list but we have strayed from the original topic our computer environment is pretty split between macs and pcs i am lucky and get to have both on my desk but there are people who have pcs and need to share data with the mac users here the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively for the pc there is no equivilant that i know of both macette and macsee have been inconsistant under the dos platform and requires you to perform the activity in a dos program to selectively transport the files the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into windows like a dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is in a pc and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs it is quite clear that this would only be available for the mb flopies tj fiske tfiske@qualcommcom

i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week if you do get multiple copies my apologies here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the pathetic state of dos as an upgrade distribution it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos that i have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it my envorinment ti travelmate winsx sx m ram m disk system bios version by texas instruments clgd vga bios v a by cirrus logic quadtel advance power manager batterypro v b by texas instruments smart drive cache windos parameters a b windows benchmark winbenchtm v by zd labs after updgrading to dos i could not understand why certain things became so slow especially after i decided to try dblspace in the process of finding out why i discovered some interesting things disk performance with double space and smart drive while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time certain applications appeared to run very much slower what was interesting is that commands like chkdsk and defrag were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards i suspected double space ds and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbenchtm the real disk winmark of for the original system as shipped from factory with dos and windowws became when upgraded to dos with ds thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than percent which did not really surprise me because i knew that ds compression must cost something specifically for short sequential reads up to bytes ds actually improves transfer rates by about because cpu being faster than io more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings in io cycles however for all other cases particularly large random writes the transfers take up to three times as long while the performance depends on the type of access ie random or sequential small or large transfer units on the average based on winbenchs assumptions the disk slows down to half its speed the tests alone done in real mode see winbench and with smartdrv on do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like there is no noticable difference in performance or even that it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and slow disk io this explained why some applications ran markedly slower but not why chkdsk and defrag the latter especially too so long double space and windows dblspace will not run at all from within windows not even if you wanted to only to get information not modify anything or for that matter even check on its usage try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you get how narrow minded can a programer get i wonder yes this information can be obtained through the mstoolsdd addon to file manager but this mstools dll does not understand a compressed floppy use the dos supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to dos defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm defragmentation seemed to take too much time even so i waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm this confirmation dblspace def command for the m drive should take no more than seconds much faster on other defragmenters i have used but it took minutes i discovered that if i moved the mouse defragmentation checking ran faster the figure ticked more rapidly it dawned on me that this had to do with tis battery saver advanced power management apm module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process after disabling the tis power saver this operation took only seconds microsft programmers think ti and gateway nomad users are idiots in the readmetxt file you can find the the following running microsoft backup with ti and gateway nomad computers to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup for windows or msdos add a l switch to the device command in your configsys that loads the batterypro file or before you run microsoft backup type setpower l at the command prompt if you checked tis manual on the l option you will realise that it means disable all power saving features of your notebook why would anyone want to run a driver disabled as i have found out not only does tis power management interfere with microsoft backup as the readmetxt claims but chkdsk and dblspace and who knows what else are crippled by the tis power saver it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications if there indeed is such a thing then either microsoft programmers or ti programmers dont know how to read these specifications you dont have to guess as to who are the idiots by the way if you run the advance power management utility powerexe in dos when you check the status it says power management status setting adv max cpu idle of time this figure of seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when i am running nothing windows with only program manager in iconised form does that mean that windows takes up of my cpu all for itself and that i have at best only left for useful work is such an overhead justified whether or not windows is an operating system or just another user interface in dos alone it reports idle time looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that i like my students to study as the classical negative example of our times microsoft programmers do not know batch programming i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this set pathcdos set pathcetcbinpathcbin set pathcetcwindowspathcwindows set pathpathcbccbin set pathpathmouse even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one ie cdos dos installation program modifes each and every path statement and prepends cdos to its value as a result my resultant path has so many doss if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path and add the new dos path clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a directory different from the old one being upgraded instead the microsoft programmer if you can call this person one decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and prepend dos to the value i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process i started a thread on this when dos came up and the microsoft representative in singapore called me about this poster in fact he specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet now that has not changed one bit in fact if you have a path statement with path already in it is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to understand batch programming i had the mouse driver invoked as set mousecetcmouse set pathpathmouse loadhigh mousemousecom guess what memmaker did it replaced the last statement with lh cetcmousemousecom why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its parameters without touching the rest of the line i do not understand dos software quality dos is the only operating system i know in which under normal usage you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it i am deliberately being cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it if they dont within a week i will post how you can create this ghost file surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of their products i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested but can only be built into the product no wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair also if you run dblspace def often enough repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented you may get errors that was created by the defragmenters i got my iosys file size error and it got truncated when i did the chkdsk this happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since microsft dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you admit that your

flangleyrh@ccsvaxsfasuedu writes stuff deld for bandwidths sake why sigh if you dont have more than mbs of memory using a ramdrive with windows is a waste of memory windows will access upto mb ram better as memory as to why what you did didnt work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the grouppifini files all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e however if you wanted to copy an application up to the ramdrive and resetup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless youve got more than mbs of ram and are using whats above as the ramdrive i personally have mbs of ram and run a mb ramdrive with a great deal of success however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things ive noted that work the best are a graphics accellerator card a coprocessor even an emulator helps some other diskcache besides smartdrive ive tried several and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major headaches as well i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup its like its trying to its bit in wearing the damn drive out i estimate its only reading a mb of programs data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed what is it that takes so much fuss perhaps if ms would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would be wanting to find a solution themselves

we have a lan where we are doing development on product for multiple platforms for the moment we are only working on mac and doswindows the department has always used sneaker net to transport files to the mac since it requires a filter to strip out the lf characters until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate and as a result the programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together at the end of each week so that a new system could be build we are now trying to streamline this process but are hampered by the lack of software that will allow us to share files across pc and mac platforms i understand that pvcs used to do this but that they no longer support the mac product anyone know why polytron i have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms so i assume that ours is not a new problem who has had to deal with it what solutions have you come up with thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or email if there are enough email responses then i will post a synopsis of the knowledge charles emmons charles emmons charles@trintexuucp these opinions are prodigy services co charlestrintex@uunetuunet mine alone unless white plains ny voice you would like to prodigy id kjrda fax share them

in composmswindowsmisc you write while reading through the dos book it states that the windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive to make things compatable i removed my permanent swap file before starting the upgrade however when all the dust settled and i go into windows it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was in the windows directory my question is how come the temporary swap files works ok with a compressed drive and the permanent one doesnt you might want to look in windows faq for this one but here is my best explanation but i cant guarantee that im not way off base the permenant swap file is readwritten to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card the controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital or something like that windows creates a file called spartpar in your windows directory that points to that file it then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file compressed disks are actually logical disks these disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk furthermore the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used ie it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the bios level because of this inbetween program windows cannot use direct methods to read from the logical disk a permenant swap file is only there to reserve an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from dos windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from dos to use that disk space i dont know if it does or doesntbut it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows a temporary swap file is just a normal dos file that is accessed by windows via dos and the bios if a disk compression program or other tsr is loaded the file access must go through dostsrs disk compressionand bios in order to be access ie never use a temporary swap filenever more on permenent swap files im sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested sizewindows will only use the size suggesteddo you want to create this swap file anyway or something like that well a friend of mine robert called microsoft and asked them what and why what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers they also said that under absolutely no circumstancesnonewill windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size wellthats what he said i call bull@ if this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if its not going to use it any takers james if this doesnt get to the net will someone post it for me thanks

im looking for a program that will let me use a windows common dialog box to select a file to use when running a dos app basically i have several dos apps that i use now and then with different files they all accept a file as a command line parameter but the only way at least that i know of to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the pif file so that it prompts me for additional parameters at which point i type in the file name problems are sometimes i cant remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager and im lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried several directory levels deep if anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this id appreciate it thanks tim the net isnt organized enough to be considered an anarchy reczek@autarchacsubuffaloedu

hello im investigating the purchase of an object oriented application framework i have come across a few that look good zapp from inmark zinc from zinc software cviews from liant win from blaise some considerations im using being new to windows programming im from the unixx world the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important however since im not adverse to learning the internals of windows programming the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one i dont believe arbitrary levels of abstraction just for the sake of changing the api are valuable since we will be developing for the bit windows nt system the memory management issues and issues particular to the windows api are less important we will probably buy another c class library something like toolsh or booch components from rational to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff allocators etc so those features are not that important for this toolkit to have the two that i have narrowed it down to are zapp and zinc they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media i was wondering if anyone had any firsthand experience with any of these toolkits especially zapp and zinc a couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are zapp seems to have the most extensive coverage of windows functionality and also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes has new fancy dstyle controls available and support for custom controls has a windows nt version essential redirectable graphics displayoutput architecture useful for printing sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize seems to be the newcomer this could be an advantage in designing a better system zinc has a platform independent resource strategy not too important for me right now comes with a interface builder tool has a windows nt version essential seems to have been around longer more mature but grew up out of a dos version had a better demo both have source code availability options both are lacking ole support neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated thanks brett harper brettharper@cimlinccom

you have a lot more problems keeping up with hardware interrupts in windows than in dos regardless of what communication software you are using try the following turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to the cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters use a different uart for your serial line the old uarts or can only buffer one character internally the new uarts can buffer which should be plenty for most situations you can run windowsmsdexe to find out what uart is on the machine ron

as the subjects says windows keeps crashing givinh me gpf on me of late it was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every day the worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie i cant reproduce crashes and they are not always gpfs in the same application sometimes i can recover by simply closing the application that caused an error but other times windows acts very strange and i need to reboot some background i have a leading edge sx with phoenix bios when i first got it it had mg of memory it ran windows fine not too many gpfs then a couple of weekends ago i installed lotus for windows with atm a game card and an additional mg simms the leading edge machine is kind of strange in that it has the ide controler built into the motherboard the cpu is actually on a sparate board that plugs into the motherboard and the simms it uses are macintosh simms apparently i was told that the leading edge had the parity bit built into the mother board the original mg ns simms where of the chip variety from samsung and the ones i installed are chip simms they are recognized fine by the bios ram check the game card is a generic gamecard the reason why i mention the hardware like this is that sometimes rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctlaltdel still leaves the machine kind of flaky but turning it on and off doesnt i havent tried taking out the ram or the game card because as i said these gpf are not reproducible at will i have gone through and entire day using the computer with no problems and then i might get or so gpfs in the sppace of minutes what can i do this situation is most annoying are there any good diagnostic tools for hardware do you think that this might be a software problem ie emm etc if it helps i have manage to get gpfs on after dark quicken paint shop pro a lot of them have been in userexe or gdiexe any help is truly appreciated eric ebosco@usoraclecom
stuff deleted be that what it may i would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these technical workshops they arent actually incredibly indepth but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know besides that they offer you huge discounts on software if i remember correctly you could pick up word excel or whatever their presentation program is for that is the full blown version not an upgrade or educational version you could also pick up microsoft office for or something like that myself i sprang for word the value of these workshops aside you ought to be able to buy full copies of all this software through your campus bookstore or software distributor at these rates im not aware that the educational version of word or excel is doped down in any way well hope that was helpful to someone and besides that i hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money and if anyone at microsoft is reading this i really love your products i need a job once i graduate also can we work something out thanks brent casavant bcasavan@mailhostecnuoknoredu david farley the university of chicago library east th street jrl dgf@midwayuchicagoedu chicago illinois

kentiler@mattksuksuedu kent p iler writes i have normal procomm plus for dos but ive been considering buying the windows versionit got really great reviews in computer shopper i have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the modemhe has a modem on a mhz machine i cant see it having trouble keeping up his pcplus for dos works great re what to do after the high speed modem arrives edition apr this article applies only to windows and and not to nt os or dos apps not running under windows one of the unadvertised limitations of most current windows pcs is that their rsc serial com performance is seriously deficient almost everyone who purchases a highspeed modem vbis v pep or hst discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming fax at after upgrading the modem overrun and retry errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or fax program if the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old bps modem there are three reasons for the problem the universal asynchronous receivertransmitters uarts used in most pcs are primitive ns devices with singlebyte fifo buffers if the operating systemdriver cannot read and flush each character at high interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the fifo and the previous one is lost dos being a fairly singleminded environment during datacomm can usually keep up windows cant windows has more operating system overhead than plain dos and interrupts often take longer to service overruns are much more likely than under dos as soon as you report to your pcmodem vendor that you are losing data you may be advised that you need to upgrade to a more likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue youll get no useful advice at all most of the storefront and mailorder sources i spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term and many didnt even know what a uart was even your pc has nsa uarts and pss do or if you can upgrade your mothercom board or add a new com board you may still experience errors and overruns because the standard microsoft windows com drivers dont take full advantage of the windows is improved in this regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrade applications like procommwin which is what i use cannot get around this problem by themselves if you have a modem card you may not have a problem as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrunning it however i wouldnt want to bet that the card designers were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever buy a modem card some modem cards dont even have conventional uarts but if they are to work with standard windows drivers they need to simulate one use msdexe below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be the hardware situation the uarts on most pc com ports are based on national semiconductor ns or ns chips or megacells inside vlsi chips where you cant replace them you can id the uart type on your system by running the microsoft diagnostic program windowsmsdexe be sure to run it in dos before bringing up windows the windows serial api may prevent msd from accurately identifying a if you run it from a windows dos prompt the ns uart has separate byte transmit and receive fifos with configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to bps although with current modem technology theres no point in pushing your luck by going over bps the has shorted access cycle times than the or the also has dma capability but it is not clear that any pc drivers ever use this for more technical info see national semiconductor application note an so what uart component do you have try to locate the uart on your mother board multifunction io card com board or isamca modem card if you cant find a socketed component with the numbers or your com ports are probably buried in vlsi and you wont be able to perform a chip replacement if you can disable your vlsi com ports as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket com board if you have one or more socketed or chips you can buy plugin nsafn or pcccn low power cmos version ics from several suppliers typically for to each the n chip is the normal pin dualinline package other styles are available but avoid any ns chips without the a the cc are presumably all ok early ns chips have bugs although national will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free clone chips are available from various ic makers other than national the manual for the turbocom drivers states support for the following apparently equivalent chips national semiconductor a chipstechnology c texas instruments tca silicon systems m vlsi c turbocom warns about the prea ns and western digital c says that problems have been reported with early ibm ps sx and systems ibm reportedly will upgrade them if you dont have socketed chips youll need to buy an after market com or multifunction board if this is a modem card situation you may be hosed to add a new com or multifunction card youll need to either disable the com ports you are replacing or reassign them to com although watch out for irq conflicts without turbocom although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly i elected buy the modular circuit technology mctaio card from jdr microdevices samaritan drive san jose ca voice us voice other fax us the mctaio and the is important sells for it is an bit isa card providing port type connector address and irq comments com dbm com irq nsafn in socket com ribbon com irq nsafn in socket parallel dbf lpt irq game ribbon the kit includes a ribbon cable and dbf connector for the secondary com port a ribbon cableconnector for the game port two bulkhead plates for the ribbonbased connectors and a ftof adaptor cable each port can be individually disabled and the com ports have tx rx rts cts dtr dcd and dsr jumpers jdr also sells a superio mf card that also has ide i have heard from several people about less expensive mf io cards with s tsd systems for the card plus per greenfield trading and distributors voice fax their card is wone w and they sell afns for rs data systems inc east highway longwood fl phone fax comlptgame card w s for i have no personal experience with any of the firms except jdr meanwhile back at the mct card from jdr i only needed two serial ports and am running out of irqs on my pc so i disabled my builtin vlsibased ports however with the turbocom driver below i could have set the internals as com and using irq sharing the software situation simply upgrading to uarts will not completely solve common overrun problems the standard ms serial drivers dont take full advantage of the the windows drivers are even less capable and the windows drivers have the following limitations they enable only the receive fifo and only at rates above bps they never enable the transmit fifo which results in an interrupt rate of x during uploads they set the trigger level at bytes too high its easy for more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the ports menu of the control panel only allows speeds up to with a vbis modem sparse data and text can easily compress or more suggesting that a host dte connect rate of bps would be effective the api wont accept rates above cbr the api wont let dos programs know there is a there and even if it did dos programs that arent aware get little benefit from a port with the standard drivers they dont allow irq sharing for com the bios doesnt initialize com properly in many systems windows provides no workaround for apps that dont provide port speed options above bps these problems are reportedly not solved in windows nt or dos and may or may not be addressed in any windows releases after but before rumors suggest they may be solved in windows you can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of turbocom current version from bioengineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or voice fax bbs mcimail compuserve price was around as i recall bioeng is not set up to accept credit cards so i had to send a check egghead and software list turbocom but as far as i know they dont stock it bio is not a software company per se they apparently needed reliable hispeed serial connections for an inhouse instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a market for it revised it to be a general purpose com driver suite they recently upgraded it for windows it is runtime licensed i now have my host dte connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm apps and i am having zero problems with downloads i routinely see transfer rates that exceed bps i am also using bps when linking an hplx to my pc with lossless bidirectional io uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts are still using antique uarts and drivers note that is still the highest rate that the windows port menu in control panel will allow in configuring a com port turbocom gets around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real uart rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the windows apis and dialog boxes i also have ctsrts hardware flow control enabled and i suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer bit ascii data xonxoff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard for xonxoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the xoff from the receiving system or device the byte fifo in the is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on xonxoff a wellrespected datacomm engineer has informed me that the s cant really do ctsrts all by itself in the doswindows environment so using data rates above may still be risky even with hardware flow control a with turbocom can still experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress if this is your situation you may need to buy a coprocessed com board but this will cost you more than a turbocom upgrade a review of two such boards and a review of turbocom can be found in the feb issue of windows sources magazine i suggest trying a turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a power user whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems closing soapbox comments the state of rsc serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry because it is the oldest standard io interface the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies the design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstation vendor i lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system that family of machines was subsequently introduced with ports however this is the exception few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent io you may as well learn what you can about serial io because this situation shows no sign of improving soon when vfast arrives i expect cries of outrage from windows users worldwide whose pcs sort of work today with v but will fail miserably with vfast without a hardwarebuffered uart like the and without software drivers that use that uart to best advantage a vfast modem will be a waste of money regards a east harmony road bob niland suite internet rjn@csnorg fort collins co compuserve

in bbc@vmscsdmuedu adubinski@vmscsdmuedu writes ahh yes this is a fun topic no once the name is incribed on the disk that is it it is encoded not even a hex editor will find it you can but a disk compare utility old versus new will and windows is also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files onto your hard disk which greatly speeds things up and makes them less annoying if you can spare the or so compressed megs write over the licensed to but you cant change the name underneth it i think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate and were not going to promote that here no were not but were also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience i dont like dealing with floppies personally i have no use for changing the registration info but i see it as a valid need and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a halfhour reinstall thats just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another so while im not going to put much time into it myself heres the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information copy all your windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it ive been using cwinstall myself from there copy that directory to something like cwinorig install from cwinstall comp the two directories to determine changes ie comp winorig reporttxt look in the report file for the files that change assuming they didnt cover themselves covering their own tracks at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset locate said offset in the original directory and see whats there using a hex editor and do the same for the modified one youre on your own as far as breaking the code goes i dont really do cryptography its probably just an xor key or something i think ms is more concerned with joe schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with real pirates who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway this technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies lotus stuff is probably like that as i noted before if you can afford the space on the hard disk and dont do much in the way of customization reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous doing some of the stuff ive mentioned here may well void your license with microsoft as if theyd ever find out if you arent careful with the disk editor you could also mung something important duh i guess thats a disclaimer have at it rob rob kudla@acmrpiedu keywords oldfield janes leather yes win phish light blue right bondage rem dtp steely dan ds fnm owl genesis in the spaceship the silver spaceship the lion takes control

hi have you used mac system x or x if the answer is positive you would know if mswindows is a mature os days ago people doubted that mswindows is not a real os i can see why they have such question mswindows confuses many people microsoft simulated mac but it did a lousy job for example you can not create hierarchy groups there is no way to create a group in a group if you know how please tell me too many system parameters to take care of uncomplete documentation its not easy to find the reason why causes an unpredictable error group deletingfile deleting after deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files but if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full of nonsense files share problem once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some language wo good editor there will be a sharing problem you just can not open or save the program if it is loaded it makes sense to prevent from saving but not opening microsoft try to compromise between dos and windows but they just make mswindows a graphical dos with capacity doing mutiple dos jobs the worst thing is they complicate the environment the orginal purpose of mswindows should be to simplify the environment and make pc easier to use its by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if microsoft want to keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute no flame please jesse emailcyen@csunteduic@solacsuntedu

hi there im having a bizarre video problem within windows i have a with a gvga video board ive been using the standard windows vga driver with other similarly configured computers i am thinking that my problem is with the way windows refreshes its screen the problem is that once windows has been envoked the colors start changing themselves at first i thought it was hardware but if you open a full screen dos program from within the windows session you dont have any problems until you get back to windows however when you initially return to windows the original colors get refreshed properly also it is not a uniform color change so if you are in solitaire the design on the back of the card maintains its original color scheme but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey then blue etc the color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purpleish black if you pop out to dos and exit back to windows the screen gets refreshed again if i dont log into windows and just do dos things from the novell network everything is fine i originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine i had just finished configuring then from the net to this machine when i ran into problems i deleted everything on this machine and the net and tried bouncing it again when that didnt work i tried reloading windows to no avail any thoughts on things to check out i am totally baffled thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction linda cornell lcornell@uwashingtonedu uw office of research

i am a novice at best in working with pc networks and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business the particular need in this case is for three machines each in a different office of the same building each having access to a windowsbased accounting system my first thought is to set up ms windows for workgroups on each of the machines likely a and two s along with the appropriate ethernet cards and cabling that come with the windows for workgroups starter kit one additional user kit will be necessary it then seems logical to purchase a simple multiuser accounting system along the lines of daceasy or myob and fire it all up the will more or less act as server with a reportcheck printer attached to it cable runs of feet will be necessary for this setup well this all seems too easy to me would any of you network gurus out there tell me if i am out of my mind here any and all suggestions however trivial will be immensely appreciated my apologies if this has been brought up before thanks john john e martin jemartin@nyxcsduedu university of puget sound kent wa formerly martin@upsedu seinfeldsupersonicsrushbelafleck john e martin jemartin@nyxcsduedu university of puget sound kent wa formerly martin@upsedu seinfeldsupersonicsbcrushdweckl

walther id have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card and screen would have without flickering id only suggest using the color screen if it does without flickering if this is not too small for your tastes at a personally id prefer the monoscreen as i always have quite a few windows open if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the color surplus is worth trading in the smaller size if you want to develop programs you will always have to check the colors i used a mono screen worst of both worlds and was surprised how the colors looked i choose on a color screen regards olaf winkelhake

we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using wwg for a while now we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway you also need a tcpip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but thats what they require to get the smtp gateway to work you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do there is a glitch somewhere in the system though i dont know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent the scenario is this the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem if anyone wants to get help it is only for one support call until problem is worked out phooey to that i say i am looking vigorously for a better idea if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew please drop me a note anyone the next itteration is supposed to have tcpip built in they say the netxt itteration of wwg good luck wes james email wesj@extsparcagsciusuedu utah state university cooperative extension systems specialist umc voice logan ut fax

brad banko writes while running the ms quick c compiler in a dos window under windows this evening i got a program has violated system integrity close all applications exit windows and restart your computer error gawd i love windows is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches youll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh data files should be examined and repaired what might have caused this does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable im suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing youre not stupid smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things a reasonably accurate prediction heres a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file the directory entry the fat chain and the data area you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of x cards the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number it also holds some other information thats not important right now the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data each square of graph paper holds a number if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file the data area x cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each in your case one cluster is bytes as a cluster is filled another is allocated to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says its the last cluster in the file chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission it doesnt have any intelligence so you have to doublecheck anything it fixes now lets do a bit of a postmortem cgfxvpiccvpicexe cgfxvpicvpictxt cgfxvpicvideocfg cgfxvpicorcprocfg cgfxvpicvgacfg cgamegoosebirdx cwinmiscadvwinadvexe allocation error size adjusted all of these files have sizes according to the fat which dont match the size reported in their directory entries chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size in other words the directory entry for cvpicexe may say the file is bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of clusters attached to it my numbers obviously are made up lost allocation units found in chains bytes disk space would be freed disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files you can then examine the files filechk through filechk and rename or discard them or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat cgfxvpiccvpicexe is cross linked on allocation unit cspartpar is cross linked on allocation unit these files are both referencing the same data cluster obviously one of them at least must be wrong its interesting to note that cspartpar is your windows swap file to fix this you should copy each crosslinked file to a new name this will fix the crosslink by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the crosslinked files examine the copies and try to assemble them properly good luck hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top bytes total disk space bytes in hidden files bytes in directories bytes in user files bytes available on disk your disk is pretty close to full this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs sorry gordon s hlavenka cgordon@vpnetchiilus vote straight ticket procrastination party dec rd gordon s hlavenka cgordon@vpnetchiilus vote straight ticket procrastination party dec rd

to those interested in the new ati ultra cards i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied the card does not work in a system with m ram a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know the vlb and eisa version should have no problems b im pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesnt work in systems with over m ram there is supposed to be way of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this but apparently it doesnt work i posted some help me messages on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didnt have this problem c false d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over m by using their configuration software no messing with jumpers necessary the m problem is probably valid only for isa cards the card works in a m system with some switches set but it is much slower a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than m ram eisa and vlb or m isa m should not be a problem for you b dunno c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus the card is interlaced in its bit truecolour modes a nope i can use x at hz bit and x at hz bit all noninterlaced b yes according to pc magazine theyve tested a local bus version that does x in bit which may or may not be interlaced c not for the pro sometimes for the plus some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to do with bits only with screen size note that for bit color and windows you must have megs memory size calculations notwithstanding the latest build drivers still do not work in many cases a they arent perfect but are much improved i dont recall the last time which i had to leave mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due to software incompatibility b true many people recommended going back to build or c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain graphs with dashed lines in mathcad do not print correctly though they do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards other accelerated cards also have bugs d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory i am running the color mode as that is all my nt driver for october nt version seems to allow i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old driver this card is the fastest full colour card for the money a its quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate b yes ill admit it was very very fast in bit mode which is what i wanted to use it for too bad it crashed in many different ways every minutes or so c depends on many many things this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread a i like it b well pc magazine seems to think it is c yes this appears to be true d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it better cards are coming out who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was developing at that time pc magazine about two months or so back overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i dont have an graphics ultra yet ati graphics ultra plus accelerated x at k colours true colourm at x multimedia video acceleration for indeo videorle and video compressed stretch full motion video windows to full size fast vga includes button mouse isa versions only antialiased fonts ed avail in colour mode onlyi think realtime pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop around a length card size priced from us ati graphics ultra pro everything in graphics ultra plus faster performance with vrams accelerated x at colours hz noninterlaced available in isa eisa and microchannel priced from us ati technologies i hope this summary can be of use to you al ps i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few years which i generally liked alan walford eos systems inc vancouverbc canada tel aew@eosvcrwimseybcca or uunetwimseybccaeosvcraew

hi my last question for the year i have a mailorder noname notebook with meg ram i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview but win and ww constantly crash on me most commonly citing a memory parity error the only thing i can do is turn off and reboot my cmos ticks off counts all the memory every startup and there is never a problem with this either could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware i remember having some disk error problems when installing it is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening i think win vs win s produce different crashes but both crash frequently nonetheless i know this is a pain but please answer by email because my home account doesnt have rn and i will stop asking questions now thank you chet pager chetter@ucthpxuctacza

in article downs@heliosnevadaedu downs@heliosnevadaedu lamont downs writes so good that there isnt any diff whether or not atmanager is turned on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especially with these better printer technologies and tt there are some fonts that are only available as ps fonts if you have a ps font that you want to use use atm otherwise it is a waste of system resources or if you need to use a service bureau and theyre only set up to use type fonts from what ive heard pure hearsay the results of outputting tt fonts as type is not as good as using highquality type fonts in the first place unless you print to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device image setter a problem with tt fonts in windows is that they do get converted to t format ok and the hinting is even used while this is done but the resulting t fonts are not hinted the result is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the ps file is generated but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution so when you print to an attached ps printer with the ps driver set up for this printer results may be quite good but if you take a ps file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution such as an image setter then the results may not be so good

thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for windows i found shareware workspace managers from australias mswindows archive monuccmonasheduau which mirrors some sites in the us the three i found were workspaces wspacezip this was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that i found it is very easy to use it displays a small window containing buttons plus an extra button for configuration purposes one annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run you must press a key not a mouse button for the thing to go away also it would have been nice if there was an always on top setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons maybe some userspecified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature the simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package workshift wrksftzip while this workspace manager offered a few features that workspaces lacked it was quite time consuming to set things up with workspaces all but the first workspace is initially empty with workshift you need to take snapshots of how you want each of your workspaces to look like ie what applications they contain also the main window is quite large but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace with workspaces there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it workshift provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful bigdesk and backmenu backdeskzip this is an interesting package which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager other goodies include backmenu which provides a popup root menu when you press a certain mouse button just like in xwindows the menu is totally configurable offering unlimited depth of cascading menus which is provides quite handy access to applications you could say it is a menubased alternative to the program manager also bundled in backdeskzip is a program called wrun which allows you to run windows applications from a dos shell under windows instead of using the file manager to run applications the actual workspace manager is called bigdesk bigdesk works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it doesnt provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces in fact it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on this means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one the bigdesk control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blowup of a particular section try each of them out for yourself i was impressed with all of them so find out which one suits your needs the best

i have a bat file that i run under a windows icon i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable my problem is that on some of our machines running msdos and windows in enhanced mode the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error i have raised the amount of environment space to bytes using the shell command in configsys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out from the windows resource toolkit for winworkgroups add an entry to your systemini file under the nonwindowsapp section commandenvsizennnn this sets the commandcom env size where nnnn must either be or between and a value of disables the setting if this value is too small or too big it is rounded up to or down to if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled as if it were if you specify the environment size in a pif file for commandcom the pif setting overrides this setting the default is with msdos versions earlier than otherwise the default value is the e option in the shell command in configsys to set this value you must edit your systemini and reboot i have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from the configsys shell line and both give larger environments if you dont use one of these then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment variables present when windows was started no matter how big the dos env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes this should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary jerome jerry schneider domain jls@atgcom aspen technology group uucp uunetcsnatglabjls po box ft collins co voice

ok i have a dxisa w diamond stealth vram mb i was really satisfied w its performance in windows but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos vga especially this new strike commander this stealth vram can only give me fps i use dbench my winmark was million i think so right now im considering to replace it w a new card which hopefully can perform approx same w my current vram in windows and also can perform dos vga preferably fps i also saw the dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it in csipg and it looked that speedstar x and orchid prodesigner ds ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard both can give fps in dos vga w dx does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor type which one is the worthiestnot necessarily fastest any other card recommendation is welcomed too also if possible where can i get this card for the cheapest thanks in advance folks martin

is anyone out there running a msdos system with a localtalk board i am on an appletalk network hooked up with a daystar digital lt mc localtalk interface board running on a ps model im using the appleshare pc software for file server and network access it works fine under dos or the window or os dos box but when i try to load it before windows so that every application i run could get access to it the machine crashes hard as soon as i start up an application and of course things look pretty hopeless for os but who knows so does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup duncan duncans@phoenixprincetonedu
a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning communicating between vb and msaccess using dde the answers i received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working however during this process i have come up with new problems there seems to be a limit of characters for a dde topic string is this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess or vb it is easy to query an access database from vb using the dde sql command provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names but how is one meant to update a database a a dde sql update command does not seem to work b initiating an access macro using a dde execute command from vb cannot be used because when the macro requests information from vb using a second dde channel the programs dead lock until time outs occur the vb to access channel has to close before the access to vb channel is initiated i guess c access does not allow vb to dde poke the information the way i eventually managed to update a database was by sending key strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command this technique has the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of keystrokes vb sends are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect assumptions are there any better work arounds to the above are there any signs of an odbc driver for access bob ran@docicacuk

to clarify vc is considered an upgrade for c there will be no product called c although the commandline compiler of vc lists its version as c is not a dosonly product it is a cc compiler capable of producing executables for dos or windows as is vc pro ed the significant difference is that vc comes with many windowshosted tools ide etc which assist developers in creating windows executables much more quickly basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code initial impressions have been very favorable everyone who is a registered user of c should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of c if you havent call microsoft and im sure theyd be happy to send you some jefrem iwaniw pelican software corporation

well im amazed at how successful this exercise was i received responses and requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and qe codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql qe is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other products mentioned were microsofts odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and qe only odbc quadbase rbase and qe have sql for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files however i feel that microsofts odbc looks very promising its mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say its available via ftp except its effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmers reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesnt actually interpret sql and liase with databases thats up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also its windows only its actually an extension to the windows sdk nevertheless its a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future heres my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs id really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it to a function which returns the query results in some format failing that any other access would still be better than nothing id also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing if other people are interested ill prepare a summary of what im told and post it thanks to all borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want the current version is which is fully compatible with ack paradox why the versions are different i dont know pd engine was compatible with pdox and it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now reading the box its borland paradox engine database frameworks works with any borland cc mocrosoft c or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal or later tp for windows or later for framework applications bc or later or ms cc it does have support for object useage i havent had a real chance to really use it myself but it looks fairly complete im planning to use it this summer rick rick osterberg osterber@huscharvardedu harvard yard mail center cambridge ma usa borland has a product which is called paradox engine i do not know about ms the paradox engine i know very well and it definitiely not a replacement for sql but it will enable you to save and restore records has locking et al supposedly the paradox for windows was impemented on top of it charles parker phone technical support centerline software inc fax cparker@centerlinecom cyberspace momma dont let yer children grow up to be cowboys i know borland has a library of routines for accessing paradox from within a c program they recently came out with version this works with both borland and microsofts c compiler shailesh bhobe attpspsmb ms has put their odbc sdk into the public domain its big i believe mb but worth downloading over a fast link look at ftpuunet in vendormicrosoftodbcsdk also some companies are starting to provide sql engines i just got one for rbase not exactly cheap at but it allows programs in c or vbasic under dos or windows to talk to data bases using sql functions in your code hth walter knopf fermilab knopf@fnalfnalgov check out the odbc toolikt from microsoft it is

paradox engine which is a c language interface to paradox dbase btrieve ans asci files they also sell database frameworks which includes the engine plus a collection with source of c classes for using the engine earl roethke eroethke@emscdccom i actualy have paradox engine it is a library of functions large model for accessing the paradoxs databases it seems to be working fine but i never did try it thouroughly it costs hope it will help you borland provides a database lib called paradox engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other things gary bell@nelladsccmonasheduau gary bell department of robotics and digital technology faculty of computing caulfield campus monash university australia paradox engine is the library for paradox artur babecki artur@iiujedupl borland sells the paradox engine which has all the paradox calls in it its hardly sql though you can do searches on key fields and on indivual fields but no comparison operators like so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and insertsupdates im currently using it i have an eval copy and ive linked it in to some entry screens ive written the engine library adds about k to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using borlands vroom manager now borland claims that later versions of the engine will have sql support but they dont really expect it till late in the year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out if you have any other questions let me know mike kamlet mike@vpnetchiilus yes borland sells their paradox engine separately it has c c and pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in c well at least for version of the engine which i have costed at egghead they now have version of the engine and a separate c class package for it michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox portland oregon michaelk@kentroxcom uunetkentroxmichaelk ive used accsys for paradox new version is almost ready for paradox to access paradox files from c its pretty good not sql though have heard of borland paradox engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly hope this helps good luck chris borland sells their paradox engine its a library of functions for accessing paradox db files it comes with libraries for ms c bcc turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascalwin libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff being dlls when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine i dont know if they still offer it or what the current price is i paid something like for an upgrade from the earlier version though hope this helps david taylor the commander it is easier to change the internet gtc@prismgatechedu specification to fit the program also dtaylor@cfdgatechedu than viceversa and root@cfdgatechedu author unknown but very wise if you want to do sql from within your programs check out quadbase i dont have their address oops yes i do quadbase systems inc lucerne dr sunnyvale ca usa phone voice fax ask for the sqlwin demo disk it looked good to me i have a background in embedded sql in ingres this looked real similar its a little expensive but if you order the demo and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer thatll probably run about us good luck best tom delosh borland has the paradox engine library it has libraries for both c and pascal to access paradox files under doswindows but for paradox i believe youd have buy have the sql link since pdox itself isnt sql compliant ive used the engine for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it under dos its a real pig it tacks on about k to the size of your programs tim ma associate programmer university of utah email tim@srccppautahedu i dont know about microsoft but borland sells the paradox engine for cc pascal in one package and if you want dbase compatible files there is a library called codebase from sequiter software that works with cc were using qe database libraries to do what you describe its a set of dlls accessed through a common api to talk to most of the major database formats were using it to build an application that queries several databases using sql queries all access using qe is done using sql the package is available through microway in melbourne i believe it is produced by pioneer systems in the us we have no association with microway or pioneer systems other than being satisfied customers feel free to mail me for further information chris programming for nsw national parks and wildlife service chris hutchinson box u research programmer university of new england chris@sulawlawsuozau armidale nsw paradox engine provides a complete set of c libraries for accessing paradox tables however it seems that it supports only borlandturbo c and microsoft c when i tried to compile the engines sample applications with the waterloo watcom cc bit compiler it complains that the library file llibcelib is missing even though i am quite certain that the file is not part of watcom c or the engine anybody have any success with other c compilers ronkng@hydroonca im currently developing an app with borlands paradox engine for c it also comes in pascal which has recently gone to version ie px engine is compatible with paradox and downward compat w there are indeed c libs for fox access but i cant think of the names offhand im sure someone has already written you in that regard i think i just saw an add for a fox lib in the c users journal which is a good place to look for this type of package in general by the way ive been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of px eng over the past year wouldnt recommend it for a complex multiuser appbut im staying with it for nowits like a bad marriage ive got too much time invested in learning and workarounds but if your interest is limited to a simple singleuser interface you want to build your own sql engine i take it px engine will do the job easily it doesnt sound like youll be bumping into any of the gotchas if you do write me i may be able to point you in the right direction borland has a paradox engine and database framework which gives you a c and assembler api to paradox databases this is part of boca borlands object component architecture they have technical briefs on boca pdoxeng and other products of theirs james d

sorry about that dont want to alarm anyone i dont think there is any correlation between the crashes and pctools i reinstalled ami pro and ran compress again with no problems i think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had bytes left while ftping although i would think it wouldnt matter since ami pro wasnt running at the time and i made space available immediately anyways but whatever the cause it is working now derek

id appreciate if you can email or post you positive or negative experience with this monitor especially compared to to nanao i id summarize if i got multiple responses i bought a viewsonic for use at home but after a week i took it back i felt for the money my nec fg that i use at work was a much better monitor the nec is sharper flatter less distorted and more stable i have heard complaints from people about the nec fg series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all there was nothing really broken with the viewsonic but overall it did not match up i used my ati graphics ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the viewsonic exhibited some problems that the nec did not i personally like the nonetched nec with the ocli filter and the tube on the was not as nice the had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems also it would change brightness when i switched modes and i was constantly having to fiddle with the controls and the yoke was crooked and i had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill on the postive side although not as handsome as the nec the had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy i have heard that panasonic owns viewsonic and the model is being sold through oem channels with a panasonic label on it if its available that way at a lower cost i could get more serious about it for now the nec has my vote but im searching for one of the new cheaper nec fges to see if its just as good as its older brother the fg before i decide which one to buy i have no experience with the nanao i can never keep the nanao models straight and dont have any place i can walk in to get a good comparison of all models standard employer disclaimers apply keith w johnson tektronix gpind info services wilsonville or usa internet keithwjohnson@tekcom voice fax
this is the official request for discussion rfd for the creation of two new newsgroups for microsoft windows nt this is a second rfd replacing the one originally posted in january and never taken to a vote the proposed groups are described below name composmswindowsntsetup status unmoderated purpose discussions about setting up and installing windows nt and about system and peripheral compatability issues for windows nt name composmswindowsntmisc status unmoderated purpose miscellaneous nonprogramming discussions about using windows nt including issues such as security networking features console mode and windows win compatability rationale microsoft nt is the newest member of the microsoft windows family of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish to argue about the meaning of an os the family ranges from modular windows through windows and windows for workgroups to windows nt at the high end to date microsoft has shipped over beta copies and prerelease sdks of windows nt the actual release is slated for mayjune while windows nt has an entirely new design internally it shares an application programming interface with the other members of the windows family its win api includes the win api used in win dows and the wins api subset win less threads networking and security can be used to create bit applications for windows the user interface is also practically identical to that of windows with the addition of logins and a few other features it uses program manager file manager and other applets and generally pre sents an identical appearance to the user many of the announced windows nt applications are ports of existing windows apps and nt also runs existing applications thus it appears logical that windows nt should share the following groups with the other members of the windows family composmswindowsapps composmswindowsprogrammertools composmswindowsprogrammermisc composmswindowsprogrammerwin the following groups are also clearly applicable to windows nt as well as windows composmswindowsannounce composmswindowsadvocacy in conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the windows and windows nt hierarchies is different internal structures of windows and windows nt and yet operating systems such as os macintosh os xenix and coherent all have undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate newsgroup hierarchies further windows is due for a major rewrite itself in when the fully bit protectedmode and withdosbuiltin next generation windows chicago debuts next year surely it should remain in the same hierarchy and what then would be the jus tification for separating windows nt from other windows versions discussion period the discussion period will run from april to may voting the cfv call for votes will be issued around may based on the feedback received during the discussion period no votes will be accepted prior to the cfv tom haapanen tomh@metricscom software metrics inc waterloo ont stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth now pull up thats how the corrado makes you feel car january
